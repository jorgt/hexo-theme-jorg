# Theme

This is the theme I'm using for Hexo, see it in action on my [blog](http://jorg.thuijls.net).

clone this repo into `/themes/jorg` and change the theme setting in `_config.yml` to jorg. Then add a `_config.yml` file in `/themes/jorg/` with the following:

```yml
# config
bio: 'something about you. Appears in footer.'
# Content
excerpt_link: Read More â†’
# Google
google_analytics: xxx
```

Note to self. Also check the hexo standard higlighter... it was modified. It'll need some more work before it's ready for the public.
